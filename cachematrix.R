## Create a Matrix object that is capable of caching its inverse


## Coding is very similar to that of the vector example. The vector object is replaced by a matrix object and 
## mean is replaced by inverse. 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
